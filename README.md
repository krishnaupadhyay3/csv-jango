The API server have a single root endpoint, /dataset/, that allows list and CRUD operations over a dataset object via the following API / HTTP verbs:

    GET /datasets/ - list the uploaded datasets

    POST /datasets/ - creates a dataset. This endpoint takes a CSV file as input, and stores it somewhere/how on the server as a pandas dataframe. A reference to this created object is returned by the endpoint, for instance an id or url.

    GET /datasets/<id>/ - return the file name, and size of the dataset object

    DELETE /datasets/<id>/ - delete the dataset object

    GET /datasets/<id>/excel/ - export the dataset as an excel file

    GET /datasets/<id>/stats/ - return the the stats generated by running df.describe() on the pandas dataframe as a json object

    GET /datasets/<id>/plot/ - generate and return a PDF containing a list of histograms of all the numerical columns in the dataset
